# ZicZacZoe
If Zappos were to make their own TicTacToe, it could look like this. Or not, who knows really.

I AM ZONY HZIEH, THE ZICZACZOE ROBOT THAT WILL BE GUIDING TWO PLAYERS TO THEIR DESTINIES. TWO PLAYERS WILL ENTER, ONE WILL EMERGE THE ULTIMATE ZICZACZOE CHAMPION. THE RULES ARE SIMPLE, EACH PLAYER WILL TAKE A TURN PLACING A TILE ONTO THE GAMEBOARD. SHOULD THREE IN A ROW BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED, THAT PLAYER WILL BE DECLARED THE CHAMPION. SHOULD THE BOARD BE FILLED AND NO VICTOR HAS EMERGED, I WILL SMITE THEM WITH MY SARCASTIC WIT AND JUDGMENT.

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM, EXECUTE THE TICTACTOE FILE. THE MAIN FUNCTION IS IN THERE.
